Semi-automatic system setup script
=====
This is a bash script to install packages in a freshly installed Ubuntu desktop machine.

Download - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thesantosh/fresh-install-system/master/setup.sh

Usage - `sudo bash setup.sh <option>`

Options - 
* Complete setup - 
  ..* Option - "fresh"
  ..* Installs `curl`, `git`, `git-cola`, `python-pip`, `ipython`, system packages usually required for development using `python`, `nautilus-open-terminal`, `sublime-text-2` and `zsh` (`zsh` & `oh-my-sh`).
* Individual options such as `curl`, `git` etc.

I am open to suggestions and pull-requests.
